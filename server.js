// Bonus
// You havenâ€™t learned how to handle DELETE requests, but this application offers that functionality on the front end. As a bonus, try to add the DELETE route to the application using the following guideline:

// DELETE /api/notes/:id should receive a query parameter that contains the id of a note to delete. To delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the db.json file, remove the note with the given id property, and then rewrite the notes to the db.json file.
